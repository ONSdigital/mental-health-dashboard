**Source:** The data used in this dashboard are taken from NHS England:
<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/eip-waiting-times/>
and then aggregated up to NHS Region level

**Indicator:** Percentage of first episode psychosis patients that started 
treatment in within two weeks of referral, in April 2017, by NHS Region, in England



**Caveats:** Some providers were not able to include referrals made prior to 1st December 2015 due to the way that they had previously captured data. Some providers were only able to include waiting times for referrals made to their dedicated EIP teams. These teams may only provide a services to a limited age range; often people aged 35 and under. Both of these issues mean the numbers of patients who started treatment and incomplete pathways are likely to be under reported. This mayalso result in the percentage achievement against the standard being artificially inflated. These issues mean that individual months of data should be treated with a degree of caution at this stage.
