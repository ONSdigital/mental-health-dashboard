**Source:** The data used in this dashboard are taken from the PHE
fingertips tool:
<http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/iapt#page/6/gid/1/pat/46/par/E39000030/ati/19/are/E38000010/iid/90799/age/168/sex/4>
and then aggregated up to NHS region level.

**Indicator:** Rate of reliable improvement: % (quarterly) of people who
have achieved "reliable improvement" of those who have completed IAPT
treatment

**Rationale:** Observing the positive outcomes of treatment is an
important quality measure

**Numerator:** Number of service requests in quarter with reliable
improvement in both PHQ9 and GAD7 (or other relevant ADSM) (field
Improvement). Reliable Improvement is defined as at least one paired
score (PHQ or ADSM) decreased by an amount greater or equal to the
relevant threshold and no score has reliably increased.

**Denominator:** Number of service requests in quarter who have finished
a course of treatment (field FinishedCourseTreatment)

**Caveats:** A data quality statement is produced for the monthly
reports. These can be found with the monthly data files at the following
link:<http://content.digital.nhs.uk/iaptreports>

Data are sometimes incomplete or missing for some CCGs due to incorrect
commissioner codes being provided. The data set may not include all IAPT
activity, for example when new services and reporting mechanisms are
being established, and there may be variation in coding quality and data
completenes across areas.
