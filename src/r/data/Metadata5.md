**Source:** The data used in this dashboard are taken from NHS England:
<https://www.england.nhs.uk/resources/resources-for-ccgs/prog-budgeting/>
and then aggregated up to NHS Region level

**Indicator:** Spending on mental health per 1,000 population, by NHS
Region in England, 2013/14

**Rationale:** This estimate gives an indication of the amount spent on
mental health care

**Numerator:** CCG programme budgeting returns produced using price paid
for specific activities and services purchased from healthcare
providers.

**Denominator:** Mid-year population estimates for 2013 based on all
ages

**Caveats:** Data cover CCG spending spending on mental health services.
Missing is NHS-England directly commissioned services, for which there
are no spending data either by disease category or geography. This
covers NHS England commissioning from NHS trusts, local authorities and
the independent sector. Most of this spending is believed to be on
specialised services (which would not be relevant to "common" mental
health disorders) and GPs (which can be considered a gateway ratehr than
treatment per se). No private expenditure or client/patient
contributions are included.

Data for Wiltshire CCG are not included as they were not published due
to data issues.
